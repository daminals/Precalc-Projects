# Due to the discovery made in deriving the explicit, we can theoretically increase efficiency
# by replacing the addition list with x(x+1)/2. However, this is flawed for the purposes of this
# program due to the fact that we need to solve for the previous term in a recursive formula,
# so looping through and finding all of the previous terms is what I did. Of course, we could solve
# for the previous term through the explicit formula, but that's kind of cheating ðŸ˜•
