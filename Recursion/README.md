# Recursions

Usually, I tend not to use recursions in my code.
There are other ways to solve problems after all.

However, it is worth comparing and exploring recursive solutions
to computational problems and evaluate them compared to 
my usual methods.

This expirement has shown me that recursive functions are largely 
inefficient

Utilizing something like a list for functions, as I usually do, feels
inefficient. After all, I am storing so many values that I don't
really need.

But solving for the function every single time?

Exponentially more inefficient than storing the previous solution in an array
